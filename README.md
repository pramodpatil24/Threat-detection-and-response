# 🛡️ AWS Cloud Threat Detection & Response 

This simulates real-world cloud security incidents and demonstrates automated threat detection and response using AWS-native services. Infrastructure is provisioned with Terraform and integrates GuardDuty, AWS Config, Security Hub, CloudTrail, and Lambda.

> ⚙️ Designed as a portfolio project to showcase hands-on cloud security and DevSecOps engineering skills.

---

## 🚀 Key Features

- **Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** using Terraform
- **AWS GuardDuty** detects port scans and other suspicious behavior
- **AWS Lambda** automatically isolates compromised EC2 instances
- **AWS Config** enforces compliance with encryption and network hardening rules
- **Security Hub** aggregates and visualizes findings
- **MITRE ATT&CK-aligned threat simulation**

## 🧪 Lab Walkthrough

### 1. Clone and Deploy the Lab

```bash
git clone https://github.com/securityAD/aws-threat-detection-lab.git
cd aws-threat-detection-lab/terraform

# (Optional) Update variables.tf with your AWS region and EC2 key pair

terraform init
terraform apply
```

Terraform will provision:

* A VPC, EC2 instance, and basic networking
* GuardDuty, AWS Config, and Security Hub
* A Lambda function that auto-remediates threats

---

### 2. Simulate a Threat

Follow the instructions in `attack_simulation/nmap_scan.md` to simulate a port scan attack from another EC2 instance.

---

### 3. Observe the Response

* GuardDuty will generate a finding
* EventBridge triggers the Lambda function
* The Lambda:

  * Tags the suspicious EC2 as `Quarantine`
  * Removes its ingress rules to isolate it

---

### 4. Teardown the Lab

To safely destroy all AWS resources and avoid charges:

```bash
cd aws-threat-detection-lab
./teardown.sh
```

> 💡 If the script isn’t executable, run `chmod +x teardown.sh` first.

## 📸 Screenshots

### 🔍 GuardDuty Finding – Port Scan Detection
GuardDuty identifies reconnaissance activity (`Recon:EC2/Portscan`) triggered by an Nmap scan.

### 🚨 Lambda Auto-Remediation – CloudWatch Logs
Lambda function is triggered automatically and removes ingress rules from the compromised EC2 instance.

---

### 🔒 Quarantined EC2 Instance – Tag & Isolation
EC2 instance is tagged with `Quarantine=True` and its security group ingress rules are revoked.

### 🧩 Security Hub – CIS AWS Foundations Benchmark
Security Hub shows enabled CIS benchmark and findings summary, validating compliance monitoring.

### ✅ AWS Config – S3 Bucket Encryption Rule
Config rule `s3-bucket-server-side-encryption-enabled` detects unencrypted S3 buckets in real-time.
